💡 ABOUT THE PROJECT
This project replicates a real online assessment system where users can answer MCQs, attempt coding questions, and get evaluated instantly.
It helped me learn about GUI design, time management systems, question randomization, and safe code execution using Python.

🎯 GOAL
To create an offline practice platform that offers the same experience as professional online exam systems like HackerRank or TCS iON.
